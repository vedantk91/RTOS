# RTOS Course Repository

This repository contains materials and projects from my **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)** course at Mumbai University. The course used **FreeRTOS** to explore core RTOS concepts. This repository is structured into three sections: lecture notes, assignments, and project implementations.

## Contents

1. **Lecture Notes**: 
    - Notes covering key concepts, scheduling, task management, and synchronization mechanisms.
    
2. **Assignments**: 
    - Practical exercises to solidify understanding of FreeRTOS, including:
      - Task creation and switching
      - Semaphores and mutexes
      - Queues and timers

3. **Projects**: 
    - Hands-on projects using FreeRTOS on embedded systems, including:
      - Task management and scheduling demos
      - Queue and semaphore-based inter-task communication
      - Real-time clock and event timers
      - Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) integration

## Topics Covered

- **RTOS Basics**: Task creation, task states, and task switching.
- **Inter-task Communication**: Semaphores, mutexes, and queues.
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory allocation in RTOS.
- **Timer and Event Management**: Timers, delays, and ISR.
- **Scheduling**: Priority-based scheduling, round-robin scheduling.
- **Debugging**: Techniques for troubleshooting RTOS-based applications.
